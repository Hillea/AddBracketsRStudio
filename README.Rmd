# An RStudio addin to add square brackets (if keys do not work)

RStudio addins let you execute a bit of R code or a Shiny app through the RStudio IDE,
either via the Addins dropdown menu or with a keyboard shortcut. This package contains an RStudio addin for adding square brackets (adapted from https://github.com/csgillespie/roxygen2Comment).

This package can be installed via
```{r eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("Hillea/AddBrackets")
```

## Running addins

After installing the package, the _Addins_ menu toolbar will be populated with the 
new, exported addin.
